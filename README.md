Prediction of energy demand in the power system with deep learning multi-horizon forecasting methods

Abstract: This thesis addresses deep learning methods with a focus on Temporal Fusion Transformer
(TFT) for multi-horizon load prediction in the power transmission system. The TFT model architecture
proposed for time series processing includes dynamic variable selection network, temporal processing
using encoder decoder layer and attention mechanism. The performance of the TFT model is compared
with traditional machine learning models such as XGBoost and Random Forest, and is evaluated based
on forecasts for the daily market (24 hours ahead) and the intraday market (6 hours ahead). The results
show the potential of advanced deep learning methods in improving power system management in the
context of increasing integration of renewable energy sources.
